In the 6 previous gatherings, we have met for a full day, but for the first time that we'll be gathering for _two full days_.

**[The theme of this gathering is traceability]({{site.url}}/initiatives/#traceability){: target="\_blank"}** there will be several topics around this and the 2nd will have focus on this.

## The 1st day

Program will be from 11 AM to 6 PM + dinner. The following is roughly our program.

A G E N D A
For formatting agenda, there are simply three classes that can be added behind each text paragraph:

{: .agenda-time }  
  left columnn; blue and bold.
  The column is exactly 70px wide so in a case anything else than time is prefered it has to be updated in includes/agenda.sass

{: .agenda-name }  
  right column; bold and underlined

{: .right }        
  right column; simple paragraph text, each entry creates a new paragraph

{% endcomment %}

### Open space discussions

We have more than two hours for open space discussions breaking out in smaller groups gathering around the demos and lightening speaks above, or other suggested topics from members or  [our complete list of recent initiatives]({{site.url}}/initiatives/){: target="\_blank"}.

We jointly wrap up the sessions and the goal is to form work groups around other joint efforts around the initiatives we run together.

## The 2nd day

The program will end at 3 PM to allow you to catch trains and flights.

We will be dedicated to workshops, hackathons, code camps and discussions on the topic of Tracey (Eiffel, QuTiCon, Compliance as Codeâ€¦). We'll finish the day early around 3 PM, so everyone can catch a train or plane home.

We should be able to have two tracks if needed. So it is also possible to group around subjects from [our complete list of recent initiatives]({{site.url}}/initiatives/){: target="\_blank"}, where we will be ready to present those not already presented and discuss road maps and new ideas.

### The traceability workshop

There will be one primary workshop around traceability facilitated by Praqma. We will go into more details on different projects and efforts, than the lightening talk allowed.
We hope also to present customer specific examples, maybe with the member.

The goal of this workshop is to look at the overall goals we could share in a new initiative, and then try to draft an architecture of a system that you can easily deploy and work with as it evolves through our alliance.
