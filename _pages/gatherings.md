**The CoDe Alliance** is gathering about every six to eight months. We share thoughts, presentations, and demo results and new approaches.

You'll find the next gathering announced below - unless you just missed one? Then stay tuned.

## The 8th gathering will be in Køge on June 7th and 8th

We are planning the next two-day gathering in the [Comwell Køge Strand hotel](https://www.google.dk/maps/place/Comwell+K%C3%B8ge+Strand/@55.4475229,12.1918276,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x85efc6457e1ec7fe!2sComwell+K%C3%B8ge+Strand!8m2!3d55.4475229!4d12.1918276!3m4!1s0x0:0x85efc6457e1ec7fe!8m2!3d55.4475229!4d12.1918276). Everything is arranged from dinner to snacks and nice [code camp facilities](https://www.praqma.com/stories/alliance-format/). You just have to show up.

On Day 1 we'll have presentations, lightning talks, breakout sessions and facilitated workshops.

Day 2 will have a dedicated theme.

_More details will be available soon._
