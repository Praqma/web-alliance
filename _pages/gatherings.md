**The CoDe Alliance** is gathering every six month. Gatherings are hosted by one of the members; we share thoughts, presentations, and demo results and new approaches.

## The next gathering is at Volvo in Gothenburg on November 13th and 14th

![Alliance Chat](/images/7th-gathering-v3.jpg){: .pic .right .small }

In the 6 previous gatherings, we have met for a full day, but for the first time that we'll be gathering for _two full days_.

**[The theme of this gathering is traceability]({{site.url}}/initiatives/#traceability){: target="\_blank"}**: there will be several topics around this and the 2nd day will have focus on this.

## Program

### November 13th

For formatting agenda, there are simply three classes that can be added behind each text paragraph:

{: .agenda-time }
  left columnn; blue and bold.
  The column is exactly 70px wide so in a case anything else than time is prefered it has to be updated in includes/agenda.sass

{: .agenda-name }
  right column; bold and underlined

{: .right }
  right column; simple paragraph text, each entry creates a new paragraph

**The morning will be dedicated to workshops, hackathons, and discussions on the topic of Tracey (Eiffel, QuTiCon, Compliance as Code…).** We should be able to have two tracks, if needed. So, it is also possible to group around subjects from [our complete list of recent initiatives]({{site.url}}/initiatives/){: target="\_blank"}, where we will be ready to present those not already presented and discuss road maps and new ideas.
{: .right }
**The traceability workshop:** This will be one important workshop run by Praqma. We will go into more details on different projects and efforts, than the lightening talk allowed. We also hope to present customer specific examples, maybe with the member.
The goal of this workshop is to look at the overall goals we could share in a new initiative, and then try to draft the architecture of a system that you can easily deploy and work with as it evolves through our alliance.
