In the previous 6 gatherings we have met for a full day but the upcoming gathering is special - it's the first time that we're gathering for _two full days_.

The first day will be pretty much as we usually do:

## 1st day

In the morning, the host (Volvo) will share details on how they work with Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Test and Automation. Volvo has many different teams working on improving and automating software development processes. The tool stack that's being utilized at Volvo is ambitious; Jenkins, Artifactory, Windows containers, Git, ELK stack, Jira, Confluence, SAFe, ...

Later during the day, other members will chip in and we will get status on some of the achievements since last meeting, and there will be demos of some of the initiatives that are cooking: JenkinsAsCode, The Git Phlow being compliant with both Windows and Atlassian's Jira/Bitbucket, QuTiCon...

## 2nd day

This is an extra day added to the gathering - we will conduct workshops and hands on joint development, focus will be on Tracey and Eiffel. We will take deep dives into the nitty gritty details, elaborating and compiling issues for the backlogs as we go.
