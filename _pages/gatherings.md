We are planning a two-day gathering in the Comwell Køge Strand hotel.
On Day 1 we'll have presentations, lightning talks, breakout sessions and facilitated workshops.
Day 2 will have a dedicated theme.

_More details will be available soon._

![Alliance Chat](/images/7th-gathering-v3.jpg){: .pic .right .small }

In the 6 previous gatherings, we have met for a full day, but for the first time that we'll be gathering for _two full days_.

**[The theme of this gathering is traceability]({{site.url}}/initiatives/#traceability){: target="\_blank"}**: there will be several topics around this and the 2nd day will have focus on this.

**The morning will be dedicated to workshops, hackathons, and discussions on the topic of Tracey (Eiffel, QuTiCon, Compliance as Code…).** We should be able to have two tracks, if needed. So, it is also possible to group around subjects from [our complete list of recent initiatives]({{site.url}}/initiatives/){: target="\_blank"}, where we will be ready to present those not already presented and discuss road maps and new ideas.
{: .right }
**The traceability workshop:** This will be one important workshop run by Praqma. We will go into more details on different projects and efforts, than the lightening talk allowed. We also hope to present customer specific examples, maybe with the member.
The goal of this workshop is to look at the overall goals we could share in a new initiative, and then try to draft the architecture of a system that you can easily deploy and work with as it evolves through our alliance.
